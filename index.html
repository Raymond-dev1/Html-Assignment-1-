    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
   <p>Good day, I am originally from Edo state, Born/brought up and curently in lagos state<br>
    I am a recent secondary school graduate, with no prior experience in tech.<br>
    I have no formal training in fashion but skilled as an  hair stylist<br>
    Graduating as early as 15years old has created a void in me, pushing me to try new things,and exposing me to real lifetime experience  .
    <br> which led me to the realization that my future depends on my recent actions, <br> Due to a lot of confusion ,  I had to seek guidance on a course path.<br>This led me to <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/">Altschoolafrica</a>
    where i hope to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in the tech industry<br>
    The dynamic and engaging community learning space at altschoolafrica allows me to connect with fellow enthusiasts and work on practical projects.<br>
    I am committed to leveraging my passion for technology to create solutions that make a difference in people's life<br>
    I envision a future where i can contribute to meaningful projects and grow within the tech community.
